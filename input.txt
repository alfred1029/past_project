5. 7H C (specify only to columns)
6. 7H S (specify only to stack)
7. UNDO / RE (undo last move)

MOVES: +1 for any valid move
SCORE: 
+5 for card move from deck to column

Need to run in Light theme for best experience

Example:

7H (not case sensitive, 7h / just type 7h are ok)
    it means moving 7â™¥ 
    1. To stack (if available)
    2. To available column (if any, prioritize to column 1 and so on)

RESTART (not case sensitive)
    start a new game

FLIP (f/F are ok)
    This action would open one card from deck, the bottom card would be closed if opened card >3
EXIT
    Quit game
